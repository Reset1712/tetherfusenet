# Google Play Distribution

## India

TetherFi is not allowed to be distributed in India due to allegedly infringing on a
trademark of a registered company by the same name which operates in `India`.

This is an honest mistake as I was unaware when I created the application. In order
to prevent brand confusion with this private company, TetherFi will no longer be
distributed on Google Play to users in `India`.

To avoid further confusion, the app is renamed to `TetherFuseNet`
