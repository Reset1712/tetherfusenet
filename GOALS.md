# The Goal of TetherFuseNet

The Goal of TetherFuseNet is to be useful.

I am a single, independent developer, and TetherFuseNet is completely free and open-source.
I just want to make cool useful software. Please be kind to others.

## How I Use TetherFuseNet

I use TetherFuseNet to solve a specific network related problem:

When traveling, I sometimes find myself in a few locations that do not have any kind of reliable
Wi-Fi internet, though my Android phone will often have access to it's 5G mobile network.
I have an unlimited data plan, but it only includes a severely limited hotspot data function, so
I cannot reliably use the mobile hotspot from my cell plan to share data to devices like a laptop computer.

In these situations, I use TetherFuseNet to allow my laptop computer to have access to a Wi-Fi network that is
not artificially throttled because of my cell plan. In this way, I experience the same bugs with TetherFuseNet
that you may notice when using it.

## Is TetherFuseNet Free

TetherFuseNet is open source software - it is completely free and you will never be required to pay money to
access the application or any of it's features.

### Why is TetherFuseNet Free

TetherFuseNet is free because I do not care about making income from this application,
as I have a full-time software related day job that I enjoy and pays my bills.

TetherFuseNet is a hobby project, and charging money for it would lead to me needing to artificially
paywall features in the application, which increases the maintenance burden, as is simply not enjoyable.

## Any Other Questions

If you have any other questions, please feel free to create an issue on Github, as that is the
easiest way to reach me.
